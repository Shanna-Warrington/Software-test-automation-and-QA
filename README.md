How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Somethings that can be done to make code functional would be to make it modular and DRY (don't repeat yourself). Making sections of code that can interact with each other or stand alone makes it easier to create the program and update the program. To help keep a program secure you could employ hierarchies and making variables private so that the code is not as open and accessible. Also having security coded into the program and not just using whatever independent security program is out there.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

By looking at your program through the eyes of various users, you can make your program easier to use and able to be used by more people. Not everybody has a lot of computer experience or knowledge. If you want more people to be able to use your program you need to think of how different levels of experience will interpret your program.

How do I approach designing software?

How I approach designing software is to first figure out what I want the software to do. I then try to break it down into manageable sections and plan out each section. Once I have a plan of action setup, I start designing the program. I also get others opinion during this time so that I don't get tunnel vision. After planning and designing is getting to the coding. During coding there are still going to be times where the design and plan will need to change. These changes could be due to roadblocks and just finding a better way to do something.
